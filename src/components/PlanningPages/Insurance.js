                The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 states that all two and four-wheelers must be insured with at least third-party insurance. 
                A Third-party Insurance Policy covers third-party liabilities like property damage. 
                Beyond that, you can choose a Comprehensive Motor Insurance policy for coverage against vehicle damages, vehicle loss, vehicle theft, and other calamities. It can be car insurance, bike insurance, etc., depending
                on the types of vehicles you own. Such a policy allows you to enhance the coverage with add-ons.

          <h3 className='text-lg text-red-200 font-bold my-8'>Term Insurance</h3>
            With term insurance, you get financial coverage against the chances of premature death. Such a policy 
            contains a specific tenure. The compensation specified in the policy is paid to the nominees if the 
            insured person dies within the tenure of the policy. 

            The uncertainty of life makes this type of insurance important, especially if you are the bread-earner of your
            family. In case the earning member of the family dies, the compensation under the policy helps the family to 
            remain financially stable. You can look for all-inclusive term insurance policies that provide
            coverage against various instances such as accidental deaths, terminal illnesses, and critical diseases.
